Facebook Friends Triangulation
===
Adjacency Matrix of mutual relations among Facebook friends - visualized triangulated groups of people.
Inspired by genetic triangulation matrix example as from GEDMATCH, FamilyTreeDna, MyHeritage.
Based on Facebook Application, which allows to access Facebook API for the user.
Planned to be as Internet page where user can grant access to his Facebook profile and see the statistics.
Also as nodejs/JavaScript/npm package, which can be imported in codebase.
